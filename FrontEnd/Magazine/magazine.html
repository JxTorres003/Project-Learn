					It becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands
					which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers
					of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of
					Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the
					opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which
					impel them to the separation.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
					are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
					unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit
					of Happiness.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp; That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted
					among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
					governed,
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp; That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive
					of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish
					it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such
					principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall
					seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

				<p>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long
					established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and
					accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed
					to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by
					abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp; But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing
					invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under
					absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off
					such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp; Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies;
					and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their
					former Systems of Government.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp; The history of the 46th President of the United States a
					history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct
					object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To
					prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

					<h3 class="list-title">A Brief History</h3>
					<p>Of the Curriculum</p>
					<ul class="lists">
						<li>
							<h4 class="list-subtitle">V1 - 2014</h4>
							<p>
								We launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources,
								including Harvard's CS50 and Stanford's Database Class.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4 class="list-subtitle">V2 - 2015</h4>
							<p>We added interactive algorithm challenges.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4 class="list-subtitle">V3 - 2015</h4>
							<p>
								We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we'd been relying
								on General Assembly's Dash course for these).
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4 class="list-subtitle">V4 - 2016</h4>
							<p>
								We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front
								End, Back End, and Data Visualization. They each had 10 required
								projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges.
								For the other certs, we were still using external resources like
								Node School.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4 class="list-subtitle">V5 - 2017</h4>
							<p>We added the back end and data visualization challenges.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4 class="list-subtitle">V6 - 2018</h4>
							<p>
								We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This
								was the biggest curriculum improvement to date.
							</p>
